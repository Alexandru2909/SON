            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                Our web solution provides a platform for social networking, this means our users will be able to collect profiles from social networking sites like: Instagram, Facebook, Github,..
                The users' profiles can be searched by multiple criterias, ex: hobbies, geographical areas, name, etc..
                Also, the network for each user will have the possibility to be exported in a 2D manner as PNG
            </p>
            <h3>Database</h3>

            </figure>
            <p>
                The database consists of 3 tables which atomical data.

            <p>
                Our app is a single page type.
                We say this because our goal is to develop an app which loads the user interface dinamically using HTML and CSS templates, managed by JavaScript
                <h3>4. Application Scenarios</h3>
